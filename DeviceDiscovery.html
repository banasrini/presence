           <p>
            IoT is a buzzword none of us can really ignore. One day we have 10 billion devices connected to the internet, the next it goes up to 50 billion. 
            This is not hard to believe, considering you can just stick a sensor on just about anything and plug it into the internet that rules
            our lives. 
           </p>
        
           <p> Most companies have built applications which you can use to control temperature, collect sensor readings and to talk to 
           other devices, while others deal with storing all the data that is collected, their storage and security. PubNub on the other hand, lets
           you build real-time applications for embedded devices without having to worry about the infrastructure. All you need to do 
           is build a jazzy application with which you can rule the world (Muhahahah!!), and let PubNub take care of the rest. 
           
           
           <p> This post takes you through the steps of detecting any device or machine connected to PubNub on a web-based application
             using JavaScript and Java.
              </p>
              
            <p>With all these applications and devices, one common requirement is the need to detect when machines or users are online and when
            they are offline. Presence is a powerful feature of PubNub that lets you do exactly this, all with just one line of code.
            So all you need to do is connect your embedded devices and watch them come online.

        <P> <a href = "http://banasrini.github.io/Device_discovery/">DEMO</A> . GOING TO ASK JOE TO JAZZ THIS PART UP WITH A PIC OF THE DEMO
        ALONG WITH THE LINK. 
        AND THE LINK TO THE GITHUB REPO. 
           
            <h2>Device Discovery</h2>

			<br>
            <h3> JavaScript</h3>
       

<p> <strong> STEP 1: </strong> The presence feature is an optional parameter used along with the subscribe call in JS.</p>
<br>
<p>BASIC USAGE:
<pre><code>pubnub.subscribe({
     channel: "my_channel",
     presence: function(m){console.log(m)},
     callback: function(m){console.log(m)}
 });</code></pre>
 
 <p> The presence feature will output the devices that are online as identified by their UUIDs, along with their timestamp, an action that 
 indicates join/leave/timeout and the occupancy of the channel. This information will be displayed in the console.</p>
 
 <p> But what if you want to consume this information - write it on a screen or store it somewhere? The following code lets you do 
 just that.


<p> <strong> STEP 2: </strong> The JavaScript bringing Presence to life.
<pre><code>var deviceList[],
devices =[];

pubnub.subscribe({

    channel: 'my_channel',
    presence: function(message,channel){
        if(message.action == "join"){
        	devices.push(message.uuid);
    		deviceList.append("&ltli text-align:
    		center&gt" + message.uuid + "&lt/li&gt");
      		}
        else{
          devices.splice(devices.indexOf(message.uuid), 1);
          deviceList.find(message.uuid).remove();
	}
 }
});</code></pre>


    		<br>
    		<p> Here, we define a custom function for presence which basically uses the different actions of a presence event
    		 that could occur, such as <strong>join</strong>, <strong>timeout</strong> and <strong>leave</strong>. </p>
    		 <ul>
    		 <li> If a 'join' occurs, we append the UUID to the list of devices that are online.</li>
    		 <li> If a 'leave or a timeout' occurs, we remove that UUID from the list of list of devices that are online.</li>
    		 
    		 </ul>
    		 
    		 <p>  You now have the online users, both in an array called 'devices' and also as list printed on a page. 
    		 
    	<p> 
    	This way, you can now be updated on the different devices joining and leaving your network in realtime. 
    	
    	</p>
    	
    	<br><h3>Java</h3>
    	
    	<p> <strong> STEP 1: </strong> Presence and hereNow are two features of PubNub that will show you who is online
    	at any instant. Whether you choose to use JavaScript or Java, the output for prsence is the same. You will get a 
    	an output in this format : <br></br>
<pre><code><strong>{"message":"OK","status":200,"uuids":["uuid1"],"service":"Presence",
"occupancy":1}
    	</strong></code></pre>
    	where "uuids" contains a list of the uuids online and occupancy gives the number of online users. </p>
    	<p>
    	I will be using the hereNow feature to see 'who's there?'. All you need to provide
    	is the channel name, and check if there is anyone on that channel. Yes, PubNub really makes our lives easy.</p>
    	<br>
    	<p>BASIC USAGE:
    	<pre><code>pubnub.hereNow("my_channel", new Callback() {
     public void successCallback(String channel, Object response) {
         System.out.println(response);
     }
     public void errorCallback(String channel, PubnubError error) {
         System.out.println(error);
     }
 });</code></pre> 
 
 This will output the devices that are online, again, identified by the UUIDs. In order to consume this information, all 
 you need is to modify the callback function a little. The following code shows you how to.</p>
 
 <strong> STEP 2: </strong> 
<p><pre><code>Callback callback = new Callback() {
	public void successCallback(String channel, Object response) {
	    String temp = response.toString();
	    int start = temp.indexOf('[');
	    int end = temp.indexOf(']');
	    for(int index = start+1;index&ltend;index++){
		    if(temp.charAt(index)!=','){	
		    	uuid1 = uuid1 + temp.charAt(index);
		    }
		    else{
		    	System.out.println();
		    }
	    }
    	String replaced = uuid1.replace("\""," ");
    	String[] uuidlist = replaced.split("\\s+");
    	for (String tempstring : uuidlist){
    		System.out.println(tempstring);
    	}	
	}
		
	public void errorCallback(String channel, PubnubError error){
		System.out.println(error.toString());
	}
};
	
	public void herenow(){
		Pubnub pubnub = new Pubnub("demo", "demo");
		pubnub.hereNow("my_channel", callback);
	}</code></pre>
	
	This code, modifies the information received by the hereNow function, and stores and prints it in an array called
	'uuidlist'. In this manner, you can now use this information according to your requirements.
